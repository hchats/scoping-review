Reflections:
- I'm wondering how "systematic" we should be in conducting the database searches, without turning this into a systematic review

Tasks Completed:
- Updated protocol
- Trialed search of MEDLINE (via Ovid)

To Do: 
- Get a better sense of the data analysis approach (e.g., come up with step-by-step guide to share with SC)

Reflections: 
- Still unsure what we are expecting from the data, though I guess that is the point!
- I am super keen on Luke's idea RE: using a broad search strategy and then using filtering afterwards, once we know what sort of search results we get
- Struggling to get up and running with rscopus, but just need more time
