Reflections:
- I'm wondering how "systematic" we should be in conducting the database searches, without turning this into a systematic review

Tasks Completed:
- Updated protocol
- Trialed search of MEDLINE (via Ovid)

To Do: 
- Get a better sense of the data analysis approach (e.g., come up with step-by-step guide to share with SC)
