Reflections:
- I'm wondering how "systematic" we should be in conducting the database searches, without turning this into a systematic review

Tasks Completed:
- Updated protocol
- Trialed search of MEDLINE (via Ovid)

To Do: 
- Get a better sense of the data analysis approach (e.g., come up with step-by-step guide to share with SC)

Reflections: 
- Still unsure what we are expecting from the data, though I guess that is the point!
- I am super keen on Luke's idea RE: using a broad search strategy and then using filtering afterwards, once we know what sort of search results we get
- Struggling to get up and running with rscopus, but just need more time

Reflections: 
- Kickoff Meeting was really helpful for reorientation
- Pleased that we have assigned roles (especially with Luke as coordinator)
- Looking forward to some deadlines
- Didn't get much done today
- Tried to get started with wosr (Web of Science) but need to wait for my API key to be approved
- In the meantime, I am going through existing search results (e.g., .csv files from rScopus search) and picking out some irrelevant search terms that Luke can add to his code for terms to remove (alongside "open access", "publishing", and so on)
- Might begin writing so that I am contributing something
