# Open science and open collaboration: A scoping review

TODO: Brainstorm title ideas.
IDEA 1: *Towards open collaboration in medical research: A scoping review*

## Study information

This project focus on open collaboration and is being conducted within the Science Collective. The overall aim of the Science Collective is to build a technical and social environment that encourages and makes it easy for science to be done in an open, rigorous, and collaborative way. We define open collaborative systems using the definition by Forte and Lampe (2013): "*an online environment that (a) supports the collective production of an artifact (b) through a technologically mediated collaboration platform (c) that presents a low  barrier  to  entry  and  exit  and  (d)  supports  the  emergence  of  persistent  but  malleable social structures.*" This scoping review will focus on current practices of open collaboration and open science in relation to collaboration in medical research.

From our work in medical research, we have experienced many different ways of collaborating, but rarely in the form of open collaboration. With the growing complexity and specialication in scientific practices and mehtods, together with globalisation of health and environmental issues, there is a great need for a paradigm shift in research collaboration in medical research to be able to tackle these challenges.   

### Research aims
The overarching aim of this scoping review is to map out current practices for open collaboration in medical research. 

The specific aims of this scoping review are to:
- Provide an overview of current practices of research collaboration that follow basic open principles
(e.g. transparency, accessibility)
- Summarize existing online tools and resources available to improve open collaboration in research
- 
### If helpful, please select the type of aim (non-exhaustive list):

### Anticipated Duration

- Overall: 12/2021 - 12/2023
- Research design and data collection: 12/2021 - 12/2022
- Screening resources: 12/2022 - 06/2023
- Analyses and manuscript writing: 06/2023 - 12/2023

## Design plan

### Study design

Scoping review

The protocol for this review will be registered with the (Open Science Framework)[https://osf.io/]. 

### Sampling and case selection

First, an initial search strategy in established medical research databases was developed in consultation with a research librarian. Then we used hand searches to extract further relevant literature. 

Systematic searches were carried out in SCOPUS, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. The search terms were: (open) AND (collaborat* OR science OR research OR coproduction OR co-production OR videoconferenc* OR github OR) AND (technology OR tools OR framework* OR guideline* OR principles OR best practices OR systems OR resources). The search was limited to data available in English. No date limiters were applied. MEDLINE was searched using the [easyPubMed R package](https://www.data-pulse.com/dev_site/easypubmed/). Once relevant records have been identified, the software [Connected Papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/) will be used to scan the citations of these records for additional relevant records.

Hand searches involved contacting known researchers in the field, asking for additional relevant records that may not have been identifeid with systematic searches, searcing Google for web-based records (e.g., blogs, websites, GitHub pages, social media posts) with the term "open collaboration" and searching university library databases for books on open collaboration. A maximum for 4 books will be selected and evaluated. Books will be selected based on a consensus in the research group.  

Data from all searches in online databases will be exported into text files or CVS files for further processing including removal of duplicates. Google sheets will be used to manage records including screening decisions.

Each database, hand search methods and possible identified books will be screened by one person. 

## Data Collection

### Data source(s) and data type(s)

- Journal articles published in peer-reviewed journals
- Guidelines and handbooks
- Websites and online resources
- Books

### Data collection tools, instruments or plans

Inclusion criteria: 
- Any formal document with advice, guidance, tools, experiences and/or recommendations for open collaboration (including documents where open collaboration practices are not the primary focus). We will use the definition of open collaboration from Forte and Lampe (2013) mentioned above.

Exclusion criteria:
- Documents that do not report on specific open collaboration practices

### Stopping criteria

In terms of database searches, we run the final search 01/10/22. Hand searching will be concluded when we reach conceptual saturation (i.e., when it is determined that we are not identifying any new concepts/resources). The first 1000 records will be screened on Google.

## Analysis Plan

### Data analysis approach

One author will extract data using a standardized and tested template via Google Sheets. Data regarding the data source (e.g., author, title, publciation year), open collaboration practices, and any other relevant information, will be extracted. A second author will check extracted data. Extracted data will be summarized with the descriptive analytical method described by Arksey and O'Malley (2005). 

### Data analysis process

Data analysis will be managed in NVivo Version 12.0. The descriptive analytical method is aimed at identifying and summarizing different open collaboration practices. 

### Credibility strategies

- Data extraction to be double-coded
- Narrative synthesis to be conducted by several co-authors
- The review will be documented in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR Guidelines

### Please provide a short rationale for why you selected particular strategies and how they are appropriate given your study's aim(s), or specify your credibility strategies if not on the above list

In this project we will map out current practices of open collaboration and available tools. Given the broad search terms, it was more important for us to scan several databases than double-checking abstracts in few databases. The aim was to understand and create several vignettes of possible research collaborations, both open and closed, and this we conducted a narrative synthesis from the studies.

## Miscellaneous

The aim of this scoping review is to map out current practices for open collaboration in medical research. As an additional step, we will arrange workshops with medical researchers to discuss our preliminary findings and how we can take action towards more open collaboration in medical research.
