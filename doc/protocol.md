# Open science and open collaboration: A scoping review

## Study information

This scoping review is being conducted within the Science Collective. 
The overall aim of the Science Collective is to build a technical and social 
environment that encourages and makes it easy for science to be done in an open,
rigorous, and collaborative way. 

This scoping review will focus on open collaboration and open
science in relation to collaboration. 

### Research aims

Our specific aims are to:

- Determine what the current best practices are for openly and
effectively collaborating together in a way that follows basic open principles
(e.g. transparency, accessibility)
- Map out different online tools available to improve open collaboration in research
- Understand how researchers currently collaborate
- Make recommendations for how to bridge the gap between best practices and current practice

### If helpful, please select the type of aim (non-exhaustive list):

Understanding

### Anticipated Duration

- Overall: 12/2021 - 12/2022
- Research design and data collection: 12/2021 - 04/2022
- Screening resources: 04/2022 - 08/2022
- Analyses and manuscript writing: 08/2022 - 12/2022

## Design plan

### Study design

Scoping review

### Sampling and case selection

First, an initial search strategy was developed in consultation with a research librarian. 
Then, systematic searches were carried out in SCOPUS, Web of Science, Science Direct, and relevant databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE).

The search terms were: Open collaboration, TBC

The search was limited to resources available in English. No date limiters were applied.

## Data Collection

### Data source(s) and data type(s)

- Journal articles published in peer-reviewed journals
- Published guidelines and handbooks
- Websites and online resources

### Data collection tools, instruments or plans

The inclusion criteria were:

The exclusion criteria were:

### Stopping criteria

When all planned databases have been searched and reference lists of all identified papers have been screened. 

## Analysis Plan

### Data analysis approach

Narrative synthesis?

### Data analysis process

Cochrane Handbook

### Credibility strategies

- Screening to be conducted by two independent researchers
- Narrative synthesis to be conducted by several co-authors

### Please provide a short rationale for why you selected particular strategies and how they are appropriate given your study's aim(s), or specify your credibility strategies if not on the above list

## Miscellaneous

### Reflection on your positionality (optional)
