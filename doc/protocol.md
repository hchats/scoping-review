# Open science and open collaboration: A scoping review

TODO: Brainstorm title ideas.

## Study information

This scoping review is being conducted within the Science Collective. The overall aim of the Science Collective is to build a technical and social environment that encourages and makes it easy for science to be done in an open, rigorous, and collaborative way. 

TODO: Define science, open, collaborative

This scoping review will focus on current practices of open collaboration and open science in relation to collaboration. Open collaborative systems were defined by Forte and Lampe (2013) as: "*an online environment that (a) supports the collective production of an artifact (b) through a technologically mediated collaboration platform (c) that presents a low  barrier  to  entry  and  exit  and  (d)  supports  the  emergence  of  persistent  but  mal-leable social structures.*"

### Research aims

Our specific aims are to:

- Provide an overview of current practices of research collaboration that follows basic open principles
(e.g. transparency, accessibility)
- Map out different online tools available to improve open collaboration in research
- Understand how researchers currently collaborate
- Make recommendations for how to bridge the gap between improve current practices towards open collaboration

### If helpful, please select the type of aim (non-exhaustive list):

Understanding

### Anticipated Duration

- Overall: 12/2021 - 6/2023
- Research design and data collection: 12/2021 - 6/2022
- Screening resources: 06/2022 - 9/2022
- Analyses and manuscript writing: 9/2022 - 6/2023

## Design plan

### Study design

Scoping review

### Sampling and case selection

First, an initial search strategy was developed in consultation with a research librarian. 
Then, systematic searches were carried out in SCOPUS, Web of Science, Science Direct, and relevant databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE).

The search terms were: (Open OR collaborative OR collaborating OR...) AND (collaboration OR science OR research OR coproduction OR co-production OR videoconferenc* OR github OR...) AND (technology OR tools OR framework OR guideline* OR framework OR principles OR best practices OR key components OR...) , 

The search was limited to resources available in English. No date limiters were applied.

Then, when the relevant papers have been included, the software (Connected Papers)[https://www.connectedpapers.com/] will be used to scan citations for additional relevant papers.

## Data Collection

### Data source(s) and data type(s)

- Journal articles published in peer-reviewed journals
- Published guidelines and handbooks
- Websites and online resources

### Data collection tools, instruments or plans

The inclusion criteria were:

- 

The exclusion criteria were:

### Stopping criteria

When all planned databases have been searched and reference lists of all identified papers have been screened. 

## Analysis Plan

### Data analysis approach

Narrative synthesis?

### Data analysis process

Cochrane Handbook

### Credibility strategies

- Screening to be conducted by two independent researchers
- Narrative synthesis to be conducted by several co-authors

### Please provide a short rationale for why you selected particular strategies and how they are appropriate given your study's aim(s), or specify your credibility strategies if not on the above list

## Miscellaneous

### Reflection on your positionality (optional)
