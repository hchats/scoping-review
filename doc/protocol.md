# Open science and open collaboration: A scoping reivew
## Study information
The overall aim of the Science Collective is to build a technical and social 
environment that encourages and makes it easy for science to be done in an open,
rigorous, and collaborative way. 

From an overall topic of open science this scoping review focus on open collaboration and open
science in relation to collaboration. 

### Research aims
Our specific aims are to:

- Determine what the current best practices are for openly and
effectively collaborating together in a way that follows basic open principles
(e.g. transparency, accessibility)
- Map out different online tools available to improve open collaboration in research
- Understand how researchers currently collaborate
- Make recommendations for how to bridge the gap between best practices and current practice
