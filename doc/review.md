# Objectives

The overall aim of the Science Collective is to build a technical and social 
environment that encourages and makes it easy for science to be done in an open,
rigorous, and collaborative way. However, in order to achieve this, we need to 
know a few things first.

- What does it mean to do "science"? (TODO: We need to define what it means to
do science and its values/philosophy, otherwise its difficult to define later
stuff)
- What are the specific components of science and doing science?
- Why is there "open science" and how is current science not open?
- What areas of science could be improved and made more efficient and open?

Combined, these topics are quite big and broad. Since we're collaborating on 
this project, from the start we will focus on open collaboration and open
science in relation to collaboration. Our specific objectives are to:

- Determine what the current optimal/best practices are for openly and
effectively collaborating together in a way that follows basic open principles
(e.g. transparency, accessibility) (TODO: define accessibility)
- Find out how researchers currently collaborate
    - (this will be hard to find out, we might have to use mostly our own personal
    experiences)
