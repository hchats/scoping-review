TODO: Give a brief description of what your project is about

This project...

General aim of project: Scrapping websites, resources, institutions, and
publications for projects and initiatives similar to this one. To map out the
space and as a scoping review. This has the added advantage that it would:

- Create a list of online platforms and databases that are already out there which can help researchers
- Create a repository/list of various tools/workflows/hints of how to improve your science in relation to open science
- Compile already existing resources into one place
- Determine how much new content we need to create vs how much we should reorganize old content

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

- `data/`:
- `doc/`:
- `R/`:

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using `usethis::use_package("packagename")`
through the `DESCRIPTION` file, installing dependencies is as easy as opening the
`scoping-review.Rproj` file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

documentation.
